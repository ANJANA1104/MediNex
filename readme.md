The problem statement was to create a patient data management for doctors which is user-friendly web-based application that includes personal information, medical histories, appointment scheduling, billing information, and records of medicines.
The resources suggested were HTML/CSS/JavaScript for front end, Firebase for database and authentication.

After ideation our objective was to create an application with a doctors login ,which further moves to a patient management page.These pages were created using HTML language.

The login information were planned to be stored in a database using Firebase. Only a signup and stored mails of database enables the view of patient datas.Due to the lack of knowledge about firebase,the backend was not implemented properly.But we learnt on it and surely wrote a code.
